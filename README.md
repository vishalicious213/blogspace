# BlogSpace

This is a Scrimba project. BlogSpace is the 2nd project in Module 9 (Working with APIs) of Scrimba's Frontend Developer's Path. This project makes use of the `fetch` API to get data from an external API, the `.then()` method to chain actions to the response, the `.json()` method to convert response data to JSON and __request methods__ (CRUD operations).
